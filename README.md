# Decision_Transformer_GP

train.py - train the decision transformer
inference.ipynb - model inference 
Onefunction_PI - dataset generated by using one function and one PI acquisition function 
train_data_strategy_1 - dataset adding RTG and Reward

Current experiment result:
The DT can't follow the strategy of PI acquisition, can be shown in the plot of inference.ipynb

To do:

Adding negative trajectories

Redesign RTG and Reward, rule based
